# Wine of The World DS 334 Final 

Here is my final project for Data Visualization 334 at SLU. In this project I found a data set containing wine reviews from around the world. I wanted to see how wine production looked in different countries, which varieties were produced where, and how the price impacted the points rating.

Important Variables:

Country: Where the wine is made

Points: A score given to a wine (out of 100)

Price: Price of wine bottle

Variety: Type of grape used

r_w: Denotes red or white wines

Description: Review of the wine by a taster

The following graphs, tables, and shiny app allow the user to explore wine production around the world, selecting country, variety, r_w, and price range for themselves.
